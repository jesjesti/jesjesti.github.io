        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm a passionate web developer with a love for creating dynamic and responsive web applications. My journey in web development started a few years ago, and since then, I've been dedicated to honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in various technologies.</p>
        <p>I enjoy working with modern frameworks and libraries, and I'm always eager to learn new things. In my free time, I like to contribute to open-source projects and explore new programming languages.</p>
        <p>Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just have a chat!</p>
